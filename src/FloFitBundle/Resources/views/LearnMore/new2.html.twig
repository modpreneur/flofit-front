                    <p>Often <b>INSANELY</b> fast.</p>

                    <p>One of the most prestigious fitness designations in the world‚Ä¶</p>
                    <p><b>The same one that made Arnold Schwarzenegger famous.</b></p>
                    <p>And I followed that distinction by winning Mr. California Physique.</p>
                    <p>To compete successfully against some of the best bodies in the <b>WORLD</b>, I had to study with some of the top <b>TRAINERS</b> on the planet.</p>
                    <p>I learned what really works to bring out the body‚Äôs natural beauty by cutting away fat and sculpting abs, arms, chest and legs to perfection.</p>
                    <p>What <b>REALLY</b> makes me angry is that I know, from working behind the scenes, that these celebrity transformations have <b>NOTHING AT ALL</b> to do with those workout and diet fads the media loves to latch onto.</p>
                    <p>And that‚Äôs one more reason why I‚Äôm so committed to using what I‚Äôve learned <b>REALLY WORKS</b> to help others get precisely the bodies they‚Äôve always wanted‚Ä¶</p>

                    <p>It‚Äôs based on what new scientific findings (and my own years of experience) say is the most effective way to lose weight and tone muscle quickly‚Ä¶</p>
                    <p>And <b>SPECIFICALLY</b> where you need or want it most.</p>
                    <p>Today, as a top trainer, I get constant requests from clients desperate to get in shape for an upcoming role, event, photo shoot, sports competition‚Ä¶</p>
                    <p>Or in the case of my friend international music superstar Flo&nbsp;Rida, to get back into super-ripped paparazzi-ready shape.</p>
                    <p><b>Even if you haven‚Äôt heard of Flo, you‚Äôve probably heard his mega-hits playing somewhere, like ‚ÄúSometimes I Get a Good Feeling‚Äù or his duet with Sia, ‚ÄúWild Ones.‚Äù</b></p>
                    <p>Maybe you‚Äôve seen him on <i>The Today Show ‚Äì or The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.</i></p>
                    <p>He‚Äôs sold over a hundred million singles and has a boatload of Grammy nominations.</p>
                    <p class="color-tertiary">I‚Äôll never forget when he first came to see me.</p>
                    <p>Flo had spent a lot of time in the studio and staying up late to party afterward.</p>

                    <p class="text-003">Living that rock star lifestyle had taken a toll on his once flawless physique.</p>
                    <p>He was even beginning to wonder if he had the <b>STAMINA</b> to perform for hours in front of a live audience that expected him to rip off his shirt and ‚Äúbring down the house‚Äù night after night.</p>

                                <p class="text-005">Flo came to me because he had heard about the amazing fitness turnarounds I was helping my clients achieve thanks to my <b>Rapid Body Redefinition program.</b></p>
                                <p>He felt it was <b>JUST</b> what he needed to get in shape for his upcoming tour.</p>
                                <p>But before we could get started, <b>FLO</b> had some demands I needed to meet.</p>
                                <p>First, he has a demanding schedule of personal appearances, recording sessions, and concerts.</p>
                                <p class="color-tertiary">So he doesn‚Äôt have a lot of time for working out.</p>
                                <p>Which meant that the workout program I designed for him had to be incredibly time-efficient.</p>
                                <p>Fortunately, I specialize in getting the best results in the shortest time possible.</p>
                                <p>Second, when he does work out, he demands that it be fun and motivating.
                                    <br/>That‚Äôs just the kind of guy Flo is and the way he is about everything in his life.
                                </p>
                                <p>No problem there, either.</p>
                                <p class="color-tertiary">That‚Äôs the way I am, too.</p>

                        <p class="color-tertiary">Again, no problem.</p>
                        <p>I gave Flo just a few strategic changes to his regular diet that enabled him to keep eating the foods he loves‚Ä¶</p>
                        <p>Yet still lose the fat he needed to lose.</p>
                        <p>Well, a few weeks later, Flo totally rocked that tour.</p>
                        <p>His fans really raised the roof when he jumped around the stage shirtless.</p>

                    <p class="color-tertiary">How is this possible?</p>
                    <p>Working your <b>ENTIRE</b> body up and down in this way with the <b>LADDER PRINCIPLE</b> gives you a combination of intense, body-shaping moves along with a heart-pumping cardio workout‚Ä¶</p>

                    <p>To effortlessly boost that intensity even further, every exercise is fluidly connected to the next with specially choreographed, low-intensity transitions I‚Äôve designed to take full advantage of ‚Äútransition time‚Äù‚Ä¶</p>
                    <p>By keeping your body at peak fat-burning level during the <b>ENTIRE</b> workout‚Ä¶</p>
                    <p>And for as long as possible afterward</p>
                    <p>Like when you‚Äôre rolling over onto your back, standing up and getting into position for the next movement‚Ä¶</p>
                    <p>Without you even realizing it, you‚Äôll effortlessly add even more fuel to your metabolic fire and keep it burning longer and hotter.</p>

                    <p>Maybe you‚Äôre worried about finding the time to work out? Well, guess what? If Flo can do it with his crazy schedule, YOU can do it too. No other form of exercise enables you to get better results in less time. All it takes is <span class="color-green">30 minutes or less</span> ‚Äî right at home. Or anywhere you choose.</p>
                    <p><span class="color-green">You‚Äôll learn my ‚ÄúIf You Hate it?

Those enviable features fitness magazines harp on and celebrities flaunt in photos can soon be yours.</p>

I‚Äôve even included modified movements for every single exercise, meaning that regardless of your fitness level, literally <span class="color-green">ANYONE can do it.</span></p>
                    <p><span class="color-green">Remember</span> ‚Äì FLO&nbsp;FIT workouts can be done anywhere ‚Äì in your home, in a hotel, or wherever you have a little space. The videos can even be streamed on your computer, TV, tablet, or phone. All workouts, books and other tools are always at your fingertips. Want hard copies of the FLO&nbsp;FIT DVDs and books?

                    <p>It‚Äôs as plug and play as fitness can get, like coming to my gym and walking away with your dream physique.</p>
                    <p><span class="color-green">And next,</span> let me introduce what may well be FLO&nbsp;FIT‚ÄôS single most powerful tool: The <span class="color-green">FLO&nbsp;FIT Community.</span> When you join FLO&nbsp;FIT, you won‚Äôt just have Flo and I cheering you on ‚Äì you‚Äôll have the support of thousands in the FLO&nbsp;FIT family!</p>

                    <p><span class="color-green">I can only touch on this briefly, but</span> if performance is important to you, think of what a fit, in-shape body will mean for all aspects of your life.

                <p>And it‚Äôs for you if you believe, as I do, that pushing yourself little by little to go beyond your comfort zone can not only be enjoyable, inspiring, and motivating‚Ä¶</p>
                <p>It can be the best, quickest and most direct way to get that body you‚Äôve always wanted.</p>
                <p>But you don‚Äôt have to take MY word for it. Here‚Äôs what my client Michelle, a psychiatrist from Southern California had to say:</p>
                <p class="text-02 color-secondary">‚ÄúI saw my body AND my mind transforming. It‚Äôs incredible and I‚Äôm hooked!"</p>
                <p>Another of my clients, Rudy from Los Angeles, sums up my approach very well:</p>
                <p class="text-03 color-tertiary">‚ÄúWhen I first started training, my goal was to lose weight and gain muscle. I exceeded all my expectations."</p>

                    <p>With everything I‚Äôve covered during this presentation, I don‚Äôt blame you if you‚Äôre thinking that a system like <span>FLO&nbsp;FIT</span> should be very expensive.</p>
                    <p>After all, most people would be willing to pay just about anything for a program that truly delivers mind-blowing results.</p>
                    <p>Here in LA, according to the Hollywood Reporter, top trainers have been reported to charge $3,600 for just 24 classes!</p>
                    <p><span>That‚Äôs $150 an hour!</span></p>
                    <p>But I don‚Äôt want price to stand between you and the body you‚Äôve always wanted.</p>
                    <p>So here‚Äôs how to get me as your personal trainer, the entire library of FLO&nbsp;FIT workouts, and all of the incredible tools I‚Äôve shown you today, for a tiny fraction of that cost ‚Äì for much less than even one hour of personal training.</p>
                    <p><span>Our goal</span> ‚Äì Flo‚Äôs and mine ‚Äì is to build a community of a hundred thousand successful people like you who can testify to the transformational benefits of FLO&nbsp;FIT‚Ä¶</p>
                    <p>Because I don‚Äôt think you should have to be a celebrity to get all the help and advice it takes to get you to the level of health and fitness you desire and deserve.</p>
                    <p>Building this community is why I want to make your decision to try FLO&nbsp;FIT not only one of the best but also one of the EASIEST decisions you‚Äôll ever make.</p>

        <h2>Help & FAQ</h2>
        <h3>Contact for Help</h3>
        <p>If you need help or assistance using one of the FLO FIT web sites or services, or if you have a billing, product order, or shipping related question, you can contact our support team at <a href="mailto:help@flofit.com">help@flofit.com</a>. We answer most Help inquiries within 24 hours, from Monday to Friday. Before contacting our support team, we highly recommend reviewing the FAQ below that covers many common questions.</p>
        <h3>Does FLO FIT really work?</h3>
        <p>Yes! FLO FIT is a comprehensive 8 week training program that combines cardio, strength, endurance, performance, flexibility and nutrition in a unique system that will provide immediate results. The workouts are structured around targeting all of the major muscle groups. It is a total body workout for both men and women that will help you lose weight, add muscle, and dramatically improve your overall health and wellness.</p>
        <h3>Is this the real deal? Does FLO RIDA use this workout?</h3>
        <p>Yes! This FLO FIT program was inspired by FLO‚Äôs training with Mike Saffaie, a personal trainer in California that got FLO in the best shape of his life. FLO loved Mike‚Äôs training so much that he worked with Mike to produce a workout and diet program that all of his fans could have access to. FLO wanted everyone to be able to train with Mike.</p>
        <h3>What exercise equipment will I need?</h3>
        <p>The ONLY equipment required is a pair of hand-held weights or dumbbells. They do not need to be heavy, as FLO RIDA himself only uses anywhere from 10 to 25lb weights. Hand weights or dumbbells can be purchased at any sports equipment retailer. FLO FIT was specifically designed to minimize required exercise equipment, which keeps the costs down and allows you to get started right away.</p>
        <h3>Who is FLO FIT for?</h3>
        <p>FLO FIT is for men or women looking to lose weight, get in shape, add muscle, strengthen their body, raise their conditioning or for anyone that loves a good hard workout program. FLO FIT is also an excellent sport conditioning program that will improve your performance in any athletic discipline such as basketball, soccer, football, hockey, or other common sports. FLO FIT was designed to accommodate everyone, regardless of their starting fitness level. The workouts offer clear instruction and all exercises include modifications that can be used if you're a beginner or out of shape. As you progress through the 8 Weeks you can gradually implement the harder exercises and increase your reps and dumbbell weight as you become stronger and more fit.</p>
        <h3>I‚Äôve never been in a gym or worked out before? Is FLO FIT for me?</h3>
        <p>YES. The exercises are designed with progressions across the 8 week calendar provided (beginner, intermediate, and advanced) and are explained and demonstrated clearly, including modified versions of challenging exercises. The short workout durations allow you to follow along at whatever pace you are capable, increasing reps and speed over time.</p>
        <h3>What do I eat? What can I eat while doing the FLO FIT program?</h3>
        <p>There‚Äôs tons of nutrition and advice within the FLO FIT customer site, including videos, blog postings, and other content. We also highly recommend the FLO FIT Nutrition Guide and 8 Week Meal Plan. These resources will establish guidelines for your eating habits and food choices for the 8 weeks of the Program and beyond. It will also address specific topics like pre and post-workout fueling, healthy meal options, and simple do's and don'ts for the best results. Nutrition is a critical component of any workout program, and the FLO FIT Nutrition Guide and Meal Plan covers everything you need to know.</p>
        <h3>Will I lose weight?</h3>
        <p>YES. Unless you're already extremely lean, EVERYONE will lose weight and reduce their body fat % on the FLO FIT program. Depending on your starting point the total amount of weight loss will vary. To maximize your weight loss at a healthy rate consult your physician, and refer to the FLO FIT Nutrition Guide and Meal Plan, and the other resources available on the FLO FIT web site. Avoid crash diets or food fads at all costs.</p>
        <h3>What if some exercises are too hard?</h3>
        <p>Each exercise is demonstrated by FLO RIDA‚Äôs trainer Mike Saffaie and modifications are provided so that if it is too hard or too easy you can adjust yourself. There are options at every step, and they are explained and demonstrated throughout the workouts. There‚Äôs also a Foundations Move video included with FLO FIT that shows how to properly complete all of the basic exercise moves in the FLO FIT workouts.</p>
        <h3>Can I Get FLO FIT Workout DVDs and Books Shipped To Me?</h3>

        <p>As people and situations vary, you should assume individual results vary, and any testimonials are not claimed to be representative of typical results. Although all testimonials are real customers, they may or may not reflect a typical customers experience. Because many of our best results come from the transformation contests we host, assume that each testimonial has been compensated with prize money. Contests are free to enter. Testimonials name, location or story may be altered to protect their privacy. Each individual has a unique set of lifestyle constraints, experiences, nutrition habits, physical activity habits, and applies the information in a different way. The experiences that FLO FIT shares from other clients may not reflect the typical users' experience. The most important factor to your success is your ability to follow through with the program. Many people do not follow through and thus, their typical results are zero. There is no such thing as a magic short cut to your weight loss goals. Your results will be directly related to your consistency and effort you put into the program. Results displayed on this website showcase what the best and most motivated FLO FIT users have achieved. Finally, you assume certain risks inherent with nutrition and exercise by using this program. You should not take part in this program if you have a medical or physical condition that makes exercise dangerous. FLO FIT and/or Mike Saffaie are not a substitute for medical advice and you should consult a physician before beginning any exercise or diet program.</p>
